<summary><strong>START SCREEN</strong></summary>

**Elements and Mood:**  
Visual: The user is positioned as a goalie on a soccer field, facing an opposing goal that serves as the interactive start menu, set against a backdrop of energetically cheering fans.

**Why This Start Screen:**  
- **Immediacy:** Placing the user directly in the goalie position immediately immerses them in the core experience of the game, aligning with the game’s focus on goalkeeping duels.
- **Anticipation:** Viewing the opposing goal and seeing the crowd sets the stage and builds anticipation, subtly communicating that they will soon be part of an exciting match-up.
- **Simplicity:** The straightforward environment avoids overwhelming the user with too many initial options or information, making it welcoming for users of all experience levels.

**What is Next in Future Design?**  
In the subsequent phases of design, audio elements, and interactive features will be integrated to enhance user engagement right from the home screen. The incorporation of spatial audio will immerse users in an auditory environment, where cheers from the fans, subtle field noises, and dynamic commentary come from all directions. Furthermore, the ability to physically interact with the soccer ball on the home screen will be introduced; users can pick it up and shoot it toward the goal, where the buttons are placed. Shooting the ball at a button will activate the corresponding option. Additionally, to augment the 3D visual experience, we will add more depth to the background.

**What is the Mood?**  
The overarching mood will be excitement, anticipation, and energetic readiness. The user, when entering the virtual space, should immediately be in a wave of exhilaration and be mentally and physically ready to dive into action.

**How Will We Achieve That Mood?**  
Achieving the desired mood will be achieved through a combination of visual cues, soundscapes, and interactive elements. The fans in the stands will not just be visual entities but will cheer, chant, and react dynamically to the user’s actions. Sound effects will be realistically designed, providing an authentic experience. Moreover, the visual and interactive elements will be crafted to be responsive and engaging; for instance, successfully hitting a button with the ball might trigger a round of applause or a celebratory cheer from the crowd.
